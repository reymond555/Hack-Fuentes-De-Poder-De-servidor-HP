it does not include ovp modifications or any other parameters, 
it was simply extracted with the pickit 5 tool and later converted
 to a . hex file, the file is virus-free, the real intention of this
 firmware is to help all those people who dare to make modifications 
to this type of power supplies in case they need at some point to reinstall
 the factory firmware that the power supply originally came with.
